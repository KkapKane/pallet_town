## Overview

Pallet Town is a multi-step interactive Pokémon experience built with React, Redux, and TypeScript. This app aims to capture the childlike excitement of beginning a Pokémon journey, from meeting Professor Oak to choosing your first starter Pokémon and entering your first battle.

It’s a tribute to the sense of wonder and adventure that defined the early moments of the classic games, enhanced with music and animations that bring the nostalgia to life. The experience ends with a fully functional Pokédex for exploring the Pokémon world further.
